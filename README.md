# Welcome to Elite Dangerous Java API

I am a second year java Development student and also a Double Elite Commander. I am
always trying to make new 3rd Party Applications for ED, so I started making 
my very own ED Java API. Hopefully some of you find it useful and can help me
Complete it [here](https://trello.com/b/C1LH0xg4/edj-elite-dangerous-java-api) is a link to my Trello board with the current progress and event coverage.
## Non Programmers
If you have no programming knowledge you can contribute by sending me your player journal with the missing entries found in the Trello Board and I will add them to the API as soon as I find time.
###### Got any ideas or want to chat? DM me on Discord *XenoPyax#5647* or send me one on Twitter [@xenopyax](https://twitter.com/XenoPyax).
