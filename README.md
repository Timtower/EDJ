# Welcome to Elite Dangerous Java API

I am a second year java Development student and also a Double Elite Commander. I was 
always trying to make new 3rd Party Applications for ED, so I thought I would start making 
My very own Java API for ED. Hopefully some of you can find a use for it and hopefully 
Complete it [here](https://trello.com/b/C1LH0xg4/edj-elite-dangerous-java-api) is a link to my Trello board with the current progress and event coverage.

###### Got any ideas hints or want to chat DM me on Discord *XenoPyax#5647* or send me one on Twitter [@xenopyax](https://twitter.com/XenoPyax).
